================================================================================

Analyze this FIRST transcription chunk with a PRIMARY FOCUS on the quality of the join to the next chunk, particularly verbatim text preservation and sentence continuity. You MUST provide AT LEAST 6 DETAILED reasoning steps with thorough explanations, then score each criterion from 0 to 10 (where 10 is perfect):

# AUDIO CHUNKING INFORMATION
The audio has been chunked with 5 seconds of padding overlap between chunks to ensure continuity. This is the FIRST chunk, so it has no padding at the beginning, but includes 5 seconds of padding at the end that overlaps with the next chunk.

# WHISPER PROMPT USED
Prompt used for transcription: No prompt information available
NOTE: Consider how this prompt may affect join quality.

# CURRENT CHUNK (FIRST)
---------------------
This is a sample transcription to test the analysis functionality.
---------------------
[Current chunk with padding at end: 5 seconds]

# NEXT CHUNK
[Next chunk with padding at start: 5 seconds]
The next chunk continues the thought process with more information.

Your response MUST be a JSON object with these fields IN THIS ORDER:
- "reasoning_steps": array FIRST (with at least 6 detailed steps)
- "verbatim_match_score": int (0-10)
- "sentence_preservation_score": int (0-10)
- "content_duplication_score": int (0-10)
- "content_loss_score": int (0-10)
- "join_transition_score": int (0-10)
- "contextual_flow_score": int (0-10)

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANALYSIS
Focus on the join to the next chunk, evaluating:
1. **Verbatim Match**:
   - If 5 > 0: Is the end padding text identical, character by character, to the next chunk’s start padding? Quote both texts and highlight any differences.
   - If 5 = 0: Set verbatim_match_score to 0, as no overlap is expected. Instead, evaluate logical continuity for sentence_preservation_score and contextual_flow_score, quoting both chunk ends to justify observations. Example: 'End: "The dog" Start: "barks loudly" – logical but not verbatim.'
2. **Sentence Preservation**:
   - Are sentences continued correctly into the next chunk? Identify any sentence crossing the join, quote both parts, and reconstruct them to verify grammatical correctness (e.g., 'Current: "The fox" Next: "runs fast" = "The fox runs fast" – score 10; 'Current: "The fox" Next: "is sleeping" – score 0'). If no split, score based on logical continuity.
3. **Content Duplication**:
   - Is there unnecessary repetition at the join? Quote any duplicated text outside the overlap region.
4. **Content Loss**:
   - Is any content missing at the join? Quote text around the join to show if words/phrases are dropped.
5. **Join Transition**:
   - Is the transition to the next chunk smooth? Read across the join and describe any awkwardness.
6. **Contextual Flow**:
   - Is the context preserved? Explain any shifts in topic or intent that disrupt understanding.

**Mandatory Requirement**: In EVERY reasoning step, quote the exact text from both chunk ends involved in the join (e.g., 'Current end: "The quick fox" Next start: "jumps over"'). Observations without quotes are invalid. Example: 'Current end: "runs" Next start: "fast" – no split detected.'

### SUGGESTED REASONING STEPS
- **Step 1**: Compare the end padding of this chunk with the start padding of the next chunk. Quote both texts. If 5 > 0, check for exact verbatim matches; if 0, note logical continuity.
- **Step 2**: Check if sentences starting in this chunk continue correctly in the next. Quote the sentence parts and verify.
- **Step 3**: Look for unnecessary duplication at the join. Quote any repeated text and assess if it’s excessive.
- **Step 4**: Identify any content loss at the join. Quote text around the join to highlight missing elements.
- **Step 5**: Read across the join aloud. Quote the transition text and evaluate smoothness.
- **Step 6**: Assess contextual continuity across the join. Explain how the context flows or is disrupted.

### SCORING GUIDELINES
Assign scores from 0-10 based on these detailed criteria:
- **verbatim_match_score**:
  - 10: Exact match in overlap (e.g., 'the quick fox' = 'the quick fox').
  - 8: Minor differences (e.g., 'the fox' vs. 'the foxes').
  - 5: Partial similarity (e.g., 'the fox runs' vs. 'the dog runs').
  - 0: Completely different or no overlap when expected (e.g., 'the fox' vs. 'hello world').
  - If 5 = 0, score 0.
- **sentence_preservation_score**:
  - 10: All split sentences continue perfectly (e.g., 'The fox' + 'runs fast').
  - 8: Minor alterations but meaning preserved (e.g., 'The fox' + 'is running').
  - 5: Sentence truncated but partially continued (e.g., 'The fox' + 'fast').
  - 0: Sentence lost entirely (e.g., 'The fox' + 'Hello world').
- **content_duplication_score**:
  - 10: No duplication beyond overlap (e.g., overlap text matches, no extra repeats).
  - 8: Slight repetition within overlap (e.g., overlap slightly extended).
  - 5: Noticeable duplication outside overlap (e.g., full sentence repeated).
  - 0: Excessive duplication (e.g., multiple sentences repeated).
- **content_loss_score**:
  - 10: No loss (e.g., 'The fox runs' fully present).
  - 8: Minor loss, meaning intact (e.g., 'The fox runs' to 'The fox').
  - 5: Moderate loss, meaning affected (e.g., 'The fox runs' to 'runs').
  - 0: Significant loss (e.g., 'The fox runs' to 'The').
- **join_transition_score**:
  - 10: Perfectly smooth (e.g., reads like one sentence).
  - 8: Slightly noticeable join (e.g., minor pause in flow).
  - 5: Awkward but readable (e.g., abrupt phrase end).
  - 0: Highly disruptive (e.g., incoherent break).
- **contextual_flow_score**:
  - 10: Context fully maintained (e.g., topic continues naturally).
  - 8: Minor context shift (e.g., slight topic drift).
  - 5: Noticeable shift, meaning intact (e.g., new idea starts).
  - 0: Context broken (e.g., unrelated ideas).

IMPORTANT: Provide EXTREMELY DETAILED reasoning steps BEFORE scoring. Use examples to justify findings.
