Assess if joins are poorly executed by checking:\n1. **Verbatim Match**:\n   - If {{overlap_seconds}} > 0: Is the text in overlapping regions identical, character by character? Quote the exact text from the end padding of the previous chunk and the start padding of the current chunk, and from the end padding of the current chunk and the start padding of the next chunk. Highlight any differences (e.g., 'the dog runs' vs. 'the dogs run').\n   - If {{overlap_seconds}} = 0: Set verbatim_match_score to 0, as no overlap is expected. Instead, evaluate logical continuity for sentence_preservation_score and contextual_flow_score, quoting both chunk ends to justify observations. Example: 'End: \"The dog\" Start: \"barks loudly\" – logical but not verbatim.'\n2. **Sentence Preservation**:\n   - Are sentences split across chunks continued accurately and completely? Identify any sentence crossing a join, quote both parts, and reconstruct them to verify grammatical correctness (e.g., 'Previous: \"The fox\" Current: \"runs fast\" = \"The fox runs fast\" – score 10; 'Previous: \"The fox\" Current: \"is sleeping\" – score 0'). If no split, score based on logical continuity. \n3. **Content Duplication**:\n   - Is there unnecessary repetition beyond the intended overlap? Quote any duplicated text outside the overlap region (e.g., a full sentence repeated unnecessarily).\n4. **Content Loss**:\n   - Is any content missing at the joins? Quote text around the join to show if words/phrases are dropped (e.g., 'The dog runs' to 'fast' missing 'runs').\n5. **Join Transition**:\n   - Does the join feel smooth and natural when reading aloud? Read across the join and describe any awkwardness (e.g., abrupt topic shifts or incomplete phrases).\n6. **Contextual Flow**:\n   - Is the meaning and context preserved across the join? Explain any shifts in topic or intent that disrupt understanding.\n\n**Mandatory Requirement**: In EVERY reasoning step, quote the exact text from both chunk ends involved in the join (e.g., 'Previous end: \"The quick fox\" Current start: \"jumps over\"'). Observations without quotes are invalid. Example: 'Previous end: \"runs\" Current start: \"fast\" – no split detected.'\n\n### SUGGESTED REASONING STEPS\nUse these steps to evaluate join quality:\n- **Step 1**: Compare the end padding of the previous chunk with the start padding of the current chunk. Quote both texts. If {{overlap_seconds}} > 0, check for exact verbatim matches; if 0, note logical continuity.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the end padding of the current chunk with the start padding of the next chunk. Quote both texts and assess as above.\n- **Step 3**: Identify any sentence split across joins (previous-to-current or current-to-next). Quote the sentence parts and check if they connect correctly.\n- **Step 4**: Examine the joins for unnecessary duplication beyond the overlap. Quote any repeated text and determine if it’s excessive.\n- **Step 5**: Check for content loss at each join. Quote text around the join to highlight missing elements.\n- **Step 6**: Read across both joins aloud (previous-to-current and current-to-next). Quote the transition text and assess smoothness and contextual coherence.\n\n### SCORING GUIDELINES\nAssign scores from 0-10 based on these detailed criteria:\n- **verbatim_match_score**:\n  - 10: Exact match in overlap (e.g., 'the quick fox' = 'the quick fox').\n  - 8: Minor differences (e.g., 'the fox' vs. 'the foxes').\n  - 5: Partial similarity (e.g., 'the fox runs' vs. 'the dog runs').\n  - 0: Completely different or no overlap when expected (e.g., 'the fox' vs. 'hello world').\n  - If {{overlap_seconds}} = 0, score 0.\n- **sentence_preservation_score**:\n  - 10: All split sentences continue perfectly (e.g., 'The fox' + 'runs fast').\n  - 8: Minor alterations but meaning preserved (e.g., 'The fox' + 'is running').\n  - 5: Sentence truncated but partially continued (e.g., 'The fox' + 'fast').\n  - 0: Sentence lost entirely (e.g., 'The fox' + 'Hello world').\n- **content_duplication_score**:\n  - 10: No duplication beyond overlap (e.g., overlap text matches, no extra repeats).\n  - 8: Slight repetition within overlap (e.g., overlap slightly extended).\n  - 5: Noticeable duplication outside overlap (e.g., full sentence repeated).\n  - 0: Excessive duplication (e.g., multiple sentences repeated).\n- **content_loss_score**:\n  - 10: No loss (e.g., 'The fox runs' fully present).\n  - 8: Minor loss, meaning intact (e.g., 'The fox runs' to 'The fox').\n  - 5: Moderate loss, meaning affected (e.g., 'The fox runs' to 'runs').\n  - 0: Significant loss (e.g., 'The fox runs' to 'The').\n- **join_transition_score**:\n  - 10: Perfectly smooth (e.g., reads like one sentence).\n  - 8: Slightly noticeable join (e.g., minor pause in flow).\n  - 5: Awkward but readable (e.g., abrupt phrase end).\n  - 0: Highly disruptive (e.g., incoherent break).\n- **contextual_flow_score**:\n  - 10: Context fully maintained (e.g., topic continues naturally).\n  - 8: Minor context shift (e.g., slight topic drift).\n  - 5: Noticeable shift, meaning intact (e.g., new idea starts).\n  - 0: Context broken (e.g., unrelated ideas).\n\nIMPORTANT: Provide EXTREMELY DETAILED reasoning steps BEFORE scoring. Use examples to support your findings. Focus ONLY on join quality, as within-chunk accuracy is not the concern.\n\n### JOIN EVALUATION CLARIFICATION\nFor standard chunks, evaluate both joins (previous-to-current and current-to-next) separately in reasoning steps, quoting text for each. Provide a single set of scores reflecting overall quality unless one join is significantly worse, then justify the lower score (e.g., 'Previous join perfect, current join abrupt – score reflects average').",

This is the FIRST chunk, adjacent to the next chunk without padding.\n\n# WHISPER PROMPT USED\nPrompt used for transcription: {{prompt_used}}\nNOTE: Consider how this prompt may affect join quality.\n\n# CURRENT CHUNK (FIRST)\n---------------------\n{{current_chunk}}\n---------------------\n\n# NEXT CHUNK\n{{next_chunk}}\n\nYour response MUST be a JSON object with these fields IN THIS ORDER:\n- \"reasoning_steps\": array FIRST (with at least 6 detailed steps)\n- \"verbatim_match_score\": int (0-10)\n- \"sentence_preservation_score\": int (0-10)\n- \"content_duplication_score\": int (0-10)\n- \"content_loss_score\": int (0-10)\n- \"join_transition_score\": int (0-10)\n- \"contextual_flow_score\": int (0-10)\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANALYSIS\nSince overlap_seconds = 0, focus on the join to the next chunk, evaluating flow and continuity:\n1. **Verbatim Match**:\n   - Evaluate flow by checking if the end of this chunk flows naturally into the next chunk without duplication. Quote the last 3-5 words of this chunk and the first 3-5 words of the next chunk. Assess if the next chunk’s start repeats any of this chunk’s end.\n   - Score based on absence of duplication: 10 if no words are repeated across the join (e.g., 'Current end: \"the lazy dog\" Next start: \"was sleeping\"'), lower if there’s repetition (e.g., 'Current end: \"the lazy dog\" Next start: \"lazy dog was\"').\n2. **Sentence Preservation**:\n   - Are sentences continued correctly into the next chunk? Identify any sentence crossing the join, quote both parts, and reconstruct them to verify grammatical correctness (e.g., 'Current: \"The fox\" Next: \"runs fast\" = \"The fox runs fast\" – score 10'). If no split, score based on logical continuity.\n3. **Content Duplication**:\n   - Is there unnecessary repetition at the join? Quote any duplicated text across the join.\n4. **Content Loss**:\n   - Is any content missing at the join? Quote text around the join to show if words/phrases are dropped.\n5. **Join Transition**:\n   - Is the transition to the next chunk smooth? Read across the join and describe any awkwardness.\n6. **Contextual Flow**:\n   - Is the context preserved? Explain any shifts in topic or intent.\n\n**Mandatory Requirement**: In EVERY reasoning step, quote the exact text from both chunk ends involved in the join (e.g., 'Current end: \"The quick fox\" Next start: \"jumps over\"'). Observations without quotes are invalid.\n\n### SUGGESTED REASONING STEPS\n- **Step 1**: Assess flow from current to next chunk for duplication. Quote the last 3-5 words of current and first 3-5 words of next, noting any repeated text.\n- **Step 2**: Check if sentences continue correctly into the next chunk. Quote sentence parts and verify.\n- **Step 3**: Examine the join for unnecessary duplication. Quote any repeated text and assess excessiveness.\n- **Step 4**: Check for content loss at the join. Quote text around the join to highlight missing elements.\n- **Step 5**: Read across the join aloud. Quote transition text and evaluate smoothness.\n- **Step 6**: Assess contextual continuity across the join. Explain flow or disruptions.\n\n### SCORING GUIDELINES\n- **verbatim_match_score**:\n  - 10: No duplication across join (e.g., 'Current end: \"the lazy dog\" Next start: \"was sleeping\"').\n  - 8: Minor duplication (e.g., one word repeated).\n  - 5: Noticeable duplication (e.g., phrase repeated).\n  - 0: Significant duplication (e.g., full sentence repeated).\n- **sentence_preservation_score**:\n  - 10: All split sentences continue perfectly.\n  - 8: Minor alterations, meaning preserved.\n  - 5: Sentence truncated but partially continued.\n  - 0: Sentence lost entirely.\n- **content_duplication_score**:\n  - 10: No duplication at join.\n  - 8: Slight repetition.\n  - 5: Noticeable duplication.\n  - 0: Excessive duplication.\n- **content_loss_score**:\n  - 10: No loss.\n  - 8: Minor loss, meaning intact.\n  - 5: Moderate loss, meaning affected.\n  - 0: Significant loss.\n- **join_transition_score**:\n  - 10: Perfectly smooth.\n  - 8: Slightly noticeable join.\n  - 5: Awkward but readable.\n  - 0: Highly disruptive.\n- **contextual_flow_score**:\n  - 10: Context fully maintained.\n  - 8: Minor context shift.\n  - 5: Noticeable shift, meaning intact.\n  - 0: Context broken.\n\nIMPORTANT: Provide EXTREMELY DETAILED reasoning steps BEFORE scoring.
